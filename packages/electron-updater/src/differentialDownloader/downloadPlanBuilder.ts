/**
 * COPY gaps shorter than this many bytes between two DOWNLOAD operations are downloaded through instead
 * of being copied from the old file, so that `DOWNLOAD, COPY(gap), DOWNLOAD` becomes one DOWNLOAD range.
 *
 * Why 8 KiB: on hosts that serve one range per request (GitHub, S3 and friends — see
 * `isUseMultipleRangeRequest`) every extra DOWNLOAD range costs a full sequential HTTP round trip plus
 * ~1–1.5 KB of request/response headers, and on multipart hosts ~120 B of part framing plus a share of the
 * request; re-downloading a few KiB of data that the old file already has is cheaper than that, and a
 * plan with fewer, longer ranges also copies less from the old file (one `createReadStream` per COPY).
 * With small content-defined blocks (1–2 KiB in a stored asar region) alternating one-block gaps are common.

 * the merged DOWNLOAD `[first.start, last.end)` has exactly the length of the operations it replaces and
